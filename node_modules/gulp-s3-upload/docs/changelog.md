## Version beta-1.0

* AWS constructor now follows [AWS-SDK constructor parameters.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#constructor-property).
* pipe transform `s3()` now only takes one `options` param that is parallel to the [AWS-S3 putObject method](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#putObject-property).
  * This makes the parameters case-sensitive.
  * Transforms are filtered out of the `options` param.
* Changed lookup/transform options:
  * `name_transform` to `keyTransform` (or `nameTransform`)
  * `mime_type_lookup` to `mimeTypeLookup`
